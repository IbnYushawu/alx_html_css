📌 Project: Responsive Task Manager Web App

This project is a simple and clean Task Manager web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It supports adding and removing tasks and automatically saves them using Local Storage so your to-do list persists across sessions. The layout is responsive and switches automatically to a mobile-friendly UI on smaller screens.

🚀 Features
✔ Add Tasks

Users can add tasks using:

The Add Task button

Pressing the Enter key inside the task input field

✔ Remove Tasks

Each task includes a Remove button.
Clicking it deletes the task from the page and Local Storage.

✔ Persistent Storage

All tasks are saved in Local Storage, so refreshing or reopening the page keeps your list intact.

✔ Responsive Layout

When the screen width is 480px or less, the interface automatically switches to a mobile layout.

✔ Interaction Styles

Link hover/active: #FF6565

Button hover/active: opacity: 0.9

Max content width: 1000px, centered horizontally
